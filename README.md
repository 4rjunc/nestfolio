- `revoke_delegation()`
  - Cancel delegation
  - Reclaim voting power
  - Update records

- `query_vote_results()`

  - Generate vote analytics
  - Project outcomes

### Team Member 3: Security & Member Management
#### 5. Member Operations
- `register_member()`
  - Create member account
  - Set initial reputation
  - Assign roles
  - Call NFT mint

- `stake_tokens()` ?
  - Lock tokens
  - Calculate voting power
  - Set lock duration

- `unstake_tokens()` ? 
  - Process withdrawals
  - Apply penalties
  - Update status

#### 6. Security Features
- `verify_transaction()`
  - Validate signatures
  - Check permissions
  - Prevent duplicates

#### 7. Utils Functions 
- `nft_mint()`
  - called during `cast_vote`/ `register_member`

#### 8. Additional Features
